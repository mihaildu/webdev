# to define a container/image - write a Dockerfile

# then build the image
docker build --tag=my-first-image .

# check the image you built
docker image ls

# images are stored somewhere in `/var/lib/docker/`

# running the image (port 4000 on host maps to 80 on container)
# I assume this also creates a container
docker run -p 4000:80 my-first-image

# you can also run it in detach mode
docker run -p 4000:80 -d my-first-image

# then check your container up
docker ps

# you can also publish images online on
https://hub.docker.com/

# you can login locally
docker login

# tag the remote image before pushing
docker tag my-first-image dryhten/test:my-first-image

# then push
docker push dryhten/test:my-first-image

# after this you can run it straight from the repo
docker run -p 4000:80 dryhten/test:my-first-image

# defining multiple docker images and how to run them (services)
# using docker-compose - create a docker-compose.yml

# turn your host macine into swarm mode first
docker swarm init

# this will enable other machines (real/virtual) to join your host (the manager)
# you need token, ip & port
docker swarm join

# starting all the docker containers according to docker-compose.yml
# you can re-run this several times without killing it (e.g. to rescale)
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml my-first-docker-app

# seeing that your service is running
docker service ls

# looking at the containers running inside your service
docker service ps my-first-docker-app_web

# taking down all the services
docker stack rm my-first-docker-app

# also take down the swarm
docker swarm leave --force
